# Robot-Fruit_Game
The project is representing a game. We realized it with a graph, robots and fruits (banana and apple). 
The graph represents different routes that the robots can move on them to eat fruits. 
The robots need to eat as much as possible fruits. Every fruit brings a different score, and they need to achieve as high a result as possible. The user can't pass to the next level if he don't pass the level he is now . (Each level have a score and numbers of moves that you need to reach it to pass to the next level) . 
In the game has 2 possibilities , one is manual – the player  moving the robots to the fruits alone  , and the other is an automatic game – for that we write and algorithm who moved the robots to the fruit who's the closed to him and the robots move alone and trying to get the best result he can each level continued 60 seconds). 
The game also print the statistic of the game , there we can see which level is all the player on the game and which place you are in the list.
