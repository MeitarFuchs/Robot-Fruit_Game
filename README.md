# Robot-Fruit_Game
The project is representing a game.
We realized it with a graph, robots and fruits (banana and apple). 
The graph represents different routes that the robots can move on them to eat fruits. 
The robots need to eat as much as possible fruits. 
Every fruit brings a different score, and they need to achieve as high a result as possible. 
In the game has 2 possibilities , one is manual – the player  moving the robots to the fruits  ,
and the other is an automatic game – for that we write and algorithm who moved the robots to the fruit who's the closed
to him and the robots move alone and trying to get the best result he can , the game continued 60 seconds).
